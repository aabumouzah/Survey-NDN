This document presents the details of the Cisco VNI global IP traffic forecast and the methodology behind it. For a more analytical look at the implications of the data presented in this paper, refer to the companion document The Zettabyte Era—Trends and Analysis or the VNI Forecast Highlights tool. Annual global IP traffic will surpass the zettabyte (ZB; 1000 exabytes [EB]) threshold in 2016, and will reach 2.3 ZB by 2020. Global IP traffic will reach 1.1 ZB per year or 88.7 EB (one billion gigabytes [GB]) per month in 2016. By 2020, global IP traffic will reach 2.3 ZB per year, or 194 EB per month. Global IP traffic will increase nearly threefold over the next 5 years, and will have increased nearly a hundredfold from 2005 to 2020. Overall, IP traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22 percent from 2015 to 2020.},

@article{Gasti2013,
abstract = {—With the growing realization that current Internet protocols are reaching the limits of their senescence, several on- going research efforts aim to design potential next-generation Internet architectures. Although they vary in maturity and scope, in order to avoid past pitfalls, these efforts seek to treat security and privacy as fundamental requirements. Resilience to Denial- of-Service (DoS) attacks that plague today's Internet is a major issue for any new architecture and deserves full attention. In this paper, we focus on DoS in a specific candidate next- generation Internet architecture called Named Data Networking (NDN) – an instantiation of Content-Centric Networking ap- proach. By stressing content dissemination, NDN appears to be an attractive and viable approach to many types of current and emerging communication models. It also incorporates some basic security features that mitigate certain attacks. However, NDN's resilience to DoS attacks has not been analyzed to-date. This paper represents the first step towards assessment and possible mitigation of DoS in NDN. After identifying and analyzing several new types of attacks, it investigates their variations, effects and counter-measures. This paper also sheds some light on the debate about relative virtues of self-certifying, as opposed to human- readable, names in the context of content-centric networking.},

@article{Compagno2013,
abstract = {Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is an emerging networking paradigm being considered as a possible replacement for the current IP-based host-centric Internet infrastructure. In CCN, named content becomes a first-class entity. CCN focuses on content distribution, which dominates current Internet traffic and is arguably not well served by IP. Named-Data Networking (NDN) is an example of CCN. NDN is also an active research project under the NSF Future Internet Architectures (FIA) program. FIA emphasizes security and privacy from the outset and by design. To be a viable Internet architecture, NDN must be resilient against current and emerging threats. This paper focuses on distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks; in particular we address interest flooding, an attack that exploits key architectural features of NDN. We show that an adversary with limited resources can implement such attack, having a significant impact on network performance. We then introduce Poseidon: a framework for detecting and mitigating interest flooding attacks. Finally, we report on results of extensive simulations assessing proposed countermeasure.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.With the rapid growth of Internet traffic, new emerging network architectures are under deployment. Those architectures will substitute the current IP/TCP network only if they can ensure better security. Currently, the most advanced proposal for future Internet architecture is Named Data Networking (NDN). However, new computer network architectures bring new types of attacks. This paper focuses on the detection against Interest flooding - one of the most threatening attacks in NDN. The statistical detection is studied within the framework of hypothesis testing. First, we address the case in which all traffic parameters are known. In this context, the optimal test is designed and its statistical performance is given. This allows providing an upper bound on the highest detection accuracy one can expect. Then, a linear parametric model is proposed to estimate unknown parameters and to design a practical test for which the statistical performance is also provided. Numerical results show the relevance of the proposed methodology.},

@article{Tourani2018,
abstract = {Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a new networking paradigm, which replaces the widely used host-centric networking paradigm in communication networks (e.g., Internet, mobile ad hoc networks) with an information-centric paradigm, which prioritizes the delivery of named content, oblivious of the contents origin. Content and client security are more intrinsic in the ICN paradigm versus the current host centric paradigm where they have been instrumented as an after thought. By design, the ICN paradigm inherently supports several security and privacy features, such as provenance and identity privacy, which are still not effectively available in the host-centric paradigm. However, given its nascency, the ICN paradigm has several open security and privacy concerns, some that existed in the old paradigm, and some new and unique. In this article, we survey the existing literature in security and privacy research sub-space in ICN. More specifically, we explore three broad areas: security threats, privacy risks, and access control enforcement mechanisms. We present the underlying principle of the existing works, discuss the drawbacks of the proposed approaches, and explore potential future research directions. In the broad area of security, we review attack scenarios, such as denial of service, cache pollution, and content poisoning. In the broad area of privacy, we discuss user privacy and anonymity, name and signature privacy, and content privacy. ICN's feature of ubiquitous caching introduces a major challenge for access control enforcement that requires special attention. In this broad area, we review existing access control mechanisms including encryption-based, attribute-based, session-based, and proxy re-encryption-based access control schemes. We conclude the survey with lessons learned and scope for future work.},

In ICN, securing the content itself is much more important than securing the infrastructure or the endpoints. To achieve the security goals in this new paradigm, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of ICN attacks, their classification, and proposed solutions. In this paper, we provide a survey of attacks unique to ICN architectures and other generic attacks that have an impact on ICN. It also provides a taxonomy of these attacks in ICN, which are classified into four main categories, i.e., naming, routing, caching, and other miscellaneous related attacks. Furthermore, this paper shows the relation between ICN attacks and unique ICN attributes, and that between ICN attacks and security requirements, i.e., confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy. Finally, this paper presents the severity levels of ICN attacks and discusses the existing ICN security solutions.},

The Internet's core protocol, Internet Protocol (IP), has proven its usability and effectiveness to support a communication network.

@article{Smetters2009,
abstract = {Current networks derive their security from a communication model. The security of content is determined by who (what host) you retrieved that content from, and the properties of the communication channel over which you retrieved it -- was it encrypted, authenticated, and so on. Such security is transient, evaporating after the connection ends, and not transitive -- everyone wanting a piece of content must get it from “the horse's mouth” in order to trust it. We propose a more scalable model wherein content itself is secured, rather than the connections over which it travels. By authenticating content itself with digital signatures, and adding the ability to retrieve that content by name rather than by the identity of the host on which it happens to be stored, we can build networks with a number of desirable security and performance properties. To make content-based security practical and effective, we argue that we must authenticate the linkage between (arbitrary) names and content, rather than merely authenticating the content or its publisher. We introduce a specific proposal for securing named content effective for both current and future, potentially content-based networks.},

abstract = {The paper explores a novel technique of analysis of Electromyography or EMG signals using Kurtosis of Approximate Coefficients (KA)-based wavelet transform. The approach is applied to speed assessment of level walking of normal individuals. The signals are collected through surface electromyography sensors from three muscles of lower extremity during level walking on motorized treadmill at different speeds. The collected signals are passed through a well-known digital filter, namely Savitzky–Golay filter as the signals are heavily noised. Topographies are then extracted from the denoised data applying Kurtosis of approximate coefficients-based discrete wavelet tool. The patterns corresponding to individual Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) levels are studied and the changes in KA value with respect to speeds are compared. Results demonstrate many definite relations between walking speeds and KA values. Most regular patterns are selected for scaling. Accordingly, an algorithm is suggested for assessment of unknown walking speed and subsequently validated.},
