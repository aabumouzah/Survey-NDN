This conceptually simple shift has far-reaching implications for how we design, develop, deploy, and use networks and applications. We describe the motivation and vision of this new architecture, and its basic components and operations.

In CCN, named content becomes a first-class entity. CCN focuses on content distribution, which dominates current Internet traffic and is arguably not well served by IP. Named-Data Networking (NDN) is an example of CCN. NDN is also an active research project under the NSF Future Internet Architectures (FIA) program. FIA emphasizes security and privacy from the outset and by design. To be a viable Internet architecture, NDN must be resilient against current and emerging threats. This paper focuses on distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks; in particular we address interest flooding, an attack that exploits key architectural features of NDN. We show that an adversary with limited resources can implement such attack, having a significant impact on network performance. We then introduce Poseidon: a framework for detecting and mitigating interest flooding attacks. Finally, we report on results of extensive simulations assessing proposed countermeasure.},

abstract = {The paper explores a novel technique of analysis of Electromyography or EMG signals using Kurtosis of Approximate Coefficients (KA)-based wavelet transform. The approach is applied to speed assessment of level walking of normal individuals. The signals are collected through surface electromyography sensors from three muscles of lower extremity during level walking on motorized treadmill at different speeds. The collected signals are passed through a well-known digital filter, namely Savitzky–Golay filter as the signals are heavily noised. Topographies are then extracted from the denoised data applying Kurtosis of approximate coefficients-based discrete wavelet tool. The patterns corresponding to individual Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) levels are studied and the changes in KA value with respect to speeds are compared. Results demonstrate many definite relations between walking speeds and KA values. Most regular patterns are selected for scaling. Accordingly, an algorithm is suggested for assessment of unknown walking speed and subsequently validated.},

Those architectures will substitute the current IP/TCP network only if they can ensure better security. Currently, the most advanced proposal for future Internet architecture is Named Data Networking (NDN). However, new computer network architectures bring new types of attacks. This paper focuses on the detection against Interest flooding - one of the most threatening attacks in NDN. The statistical detection is studied within the framework of hypothesis testing. First, we address the case in which all traffic parameters are known. In this context, the optimal test is designed and its statistical performance is given. This allows providing an upper bound on the highest detection accuracy one can expect. Then, a linear parametric model is proposed to estimate unknown parameters and to design a practical test for which the statistical performance is also provided. Numerical results show the relevance of the proposed methodology.},

@article{Saxena2016,
abstract = {Internet was developed as a packet data network where users and data sources (server) with specific IP addresses interacted over a pre-established communication channel. This model of client-server data communication has evolved into a peer-to-peer mode of data sharing in recent times. Applications like, YouTube, Bit Torrent, social networks have revolutionized the idea of user generated contents. Modern users care only for specific data items irrespective of their sources. So, the idea of using IP addresses to identify servers hosting a particular content is losing its importance. Moreover, want of IP addresses is a challenging issue haunting the Internet community since long. The need of the time is a content-centric networking platform where data hosts are of less importance, and Named Data Networking (NDN) has been proposed to that end. NDN allows users to float a data request without any knowledge about the hosting entity. NDN can handle user mobility, security issues more efficiently than the current Internet. Although NDN has been proposed in 2010, so far, there is no survey paper studying its architecture and various schemes proposed for its different characteristic features, like, naming, adaptive forwarding and routing, caching, security, mobility, etc. In this paper, we introduce a novel taxonomy to study NDN features in depth. We have also covered several NDN applications. We conclude our survey by identifying a set of open challenges which should be addressed by researchers in due course.},

Because of its focus on data distribution, NDN has been assumed to be poorly suited for other networking scenarios. We address efficient and secure sensing over NDN, motivated by the convergence of the IoT vision with traditional Building Automation Systems (BAS). We consider several sensing paradigms and demonstrate the use of NDN to securely interact with NDN-enabled sensors. In the process, we address some challenges caused by sensors' intermittent availability, power constraints and asynchronous communication patterns. Our results include concrete protocols that facilitate secure sensor-bound communication over NDN.},

It also provides a taxonomy of these attacks in ICN, which are classified into four main categories, i.e., naming, routing, caching, and other miscellaneous related attacks. Furthermore, this paper shows the relation between ICN attacks and unique ICN attributes, and that between ICN attacks and security requirements, i.e., confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy.

abstract = {Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a new networking paradigm, which replaces the widely used host-centric networking paradigm in communication networks (e.g., Internet, mobile ad hoc networks) with an information-centric paradigm, which prioritizes the delivery of named content, oblivious of the contents origin. Content and client security are more intrinsic in the ICN paradigm versus the current host centric paradigm where they have been instrumented as an after thought. By design, the ICN paradigm inherently supports several security and privacy features, such as provenance and identity privacy, which are still not effectively available in the host-centric paradigm. However, given its nascency, the ICN paradigm has several open security and privacy concerns, some that existed in the old paradigm, and some new and unique. In this article, we survey the existing literature in security and privacy research sub-space in ICN. More specifically, we explore three broad areas: security threats, privacy risks, and access control enforcement mechanisms. We present the underlying principle of the existing works, discuss the drawbacks of the proposed approaches, and explore potential future research directions. In the broad area of security, we review attack scenarios, such as denial of service, cache pollution, and content poisoning. In the broad area of privacy, we discuss user privacy and anonymity, name and signature privacy, and content privacy. ICN's feature of ubiquitous caching introduces a major challenge for access control enforcement that requires special attention. In this broad area, we review existing access control mechanisms including encryption-based, attribute-based, session-based, and proxy re-encryption-based access control schemes. We conclude the survey with lessons learned and scope for future work.},

abstract = {Current networks derive their security from a communication model. The security of content is determined by who (what host) you retrieved that content from, and the properties of the communication channel over which you retrieved it -- was it encrypted, authenticated, and so on. Such security is transient, evaporating after the connection ends, and not transitive -- everyone wanting a piece of content must get it from “the horse's mouth” in order to trust it. We propose a more scalable model wherein content itself is secured, rather than the connections over which it travels. By authenticating content itself with digital signatures, and adding the ability to retrieve that content by name rather than by the identity of the host on which it happens to be stored, we can build networks with a number of desirable security and performance properties. To make content-based security practical and effective, we argue that we must authenticate the linkage between (arbitrary) names and content, rather than merely authenticating the content or its publisher. We introduce a specific proposal for securing named content effective for both current and future, potentially content-based networks.},
